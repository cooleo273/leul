## Overview

Shega Insight is a Next.js dashboard I built for Shega Media & Technologies to centralize and surface data-driven insights about Ethiopian startups. It aggregates funding deals, investor activity, industry trends, and company profiles to help product and strategy teams make informed decisions.

## Role

I am working for Shega as a Software Developer on this project — responsible for data pipelines, frontend dashboards, and integrations with external data sources.

## Technologies

- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Serverless API routes for ingestion and transforms
- Recharts library

## Implementation notes

- Frontend: completed responsive Next.js frontend (App Router + TypeScript) with searchable catalog and dashboard views.
- Data: we ingest and normalize records from Airtable using serverless API routes. Airtable is the source-of-truth for curated deal and company records.
- Charts: visualizations are implemented with Recharts for fast, interactive charts (time-series, stacked area, bar charts) tuned for performance on large datasets.

## What I built

- ETL pipelines to ingest deal and company data from public sources and partner feeds.
- A searchable catalog of startups with filters for industry, stage, and funding round.
- Time-series visualizations for funding activity by industry and investor.
- Exportable lists and CSV reports for analysts and business development.

Additionally:

- Frontend components include server-side rendered pages for SEO, client-side filters for instant exploration, and lazy-loaded chart data where appropriate to keep initial page loads quick.
- Airtable sync runs on a schedule and provides change logs which are processed into the reporting database.

## Outcome

Delivered a production dashboard that reduced the time to find relevant leads and funding signals from days to minutes. The tool is used by Shega teams for market scans and investor outreach.

## Next steps

- Add automated alerts for new funding events matching custom criteria.
- Integrate richer investor profiles and social signals.
