## Overview

Developed a full-featured e-commerce web application from concept to deployment using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

## Key Features

- Product catalog with categories and search
- User authentication (JWT) and account management
- Shopping cart with persistent storage
- Secure payment gateway integration
- Admin interface for product and order management

## Technologies

- React, Node.js, Express
- MongoDB
- JWT for auth
- Deployment to a managed hosting platform

## Outcome

Delivered a production-ready e-commerce application demonstrating end-to-end system design, secure authentication, and payment flows.

## Problem

Small merchants needed an easy way to sell products online but existing platforms were either expensive or inflexible for custom workflows.

## Solution

Built a full-stack e-commerce platform that balanced a flexible product model with secure, scalable infrastructure. The platform prioritized developer productivity and merchant customization.

## Architecture

```text
Browser (React) -> API (Express/Node) -> Database (MongoDB) -> Payment gateway
```

### Key features
- Product catalog with categories, tags, and full-text search
- User accounts, order history, and JWT-secured APIs
- Shopping cart with persistent session storage
- Integration with Stripe (or other payment processor)
- Admin panel for product and order management

## Metrics
- Supported thousands of SKUs and scaled across read replicas for product traffic
- Reduced checkout abandonment with optimized flows and cart persistence

## Lessons learned
- Keep the product model flexible but constrained: support common workflows while allowing customization through extensions.
- Security and proper token management are critical for payment flows.

## Next steps
- Add multi-tenant features, better inventory forecasting, and more payment options.
