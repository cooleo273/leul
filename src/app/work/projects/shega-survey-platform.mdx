## Overview

Built a custom survey collection platform for Shega Media & Technologies to automate data collection and reporting, replacing a manual process similar to Google Forms.

### What I built

- A responsive front-end using Next.js and React for creating and distributing surveys.
- Secure data storage and real-time listeners using Supabase.
- Aggregation and reporting dashboards that surface actionable insights.

### Impact

The system automated data aggregation and reporting, reducing the time to analyze customer feedback by approximately 40%.

## Technologies used

- Next.js, React
- Supabase
- PostgreSQL / Supabase database services
- Node.js

## Outcome

A production-ready survey platform that replaced manual processes and delivered faster, consistent feedback analysis.

## Problem

Shega's marketing and product teams relied on ad-hoc spreadsheets and manual export/import workflows to collect customer feedback. This process was error-prone, slow, and made it hard to track sentiment over time.

## Solution

I built a lightweight platform focused on three priorities: fast survey creation, reliable data capture, and actionable reporting. Non-technical staff could design surveys and share links, while stakeholders could view aggregated insights in real time.

## Architecture

```text
Browser (Next.js)  ->  API (Next API routes)  ->  Supabase (Postgres & Realtime)
                         |                             |
                         +--> Background workers / ETL --> Reporting DB / Materialized Views
```

### Key components
- Survey builder (drag-and-drop field ordering, preview)
- Respondent front-end with token-based access and anti-spam protections
- Real-time aggregation using Supabase listeners and server-side transformations
- Reporting UI with filters, trend charts, and CSV exports

## Features
- Create surveys with multiple question types (text, rating, multiple choice)
- Schedule surveys and email distribution hooks
- Live dashboards with time-series charts and top-feedback highlights
- Export results to CSV and automated summary emails

## Metrics
- ~40% reduction in time-to-insight for customer feedback
- 99.9% availability during campaign windows

## Lessons learned
- Keeping the data model simple made downstream reporting easy.
- Realtime systems are powerful for dashboards but require careful rate-limiting and batching.

## Next steps
- Add behavioural analytics (session replay snippets) and A/B test integrations.
