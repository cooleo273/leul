## Overview

At Schimerol I led the full lifecycle for the company's principal software offering — from initial architecture to production deployment.

## Key Contributions

- Architected and implemented the backend system, including database schema design and core API endpoints.
- Ensured the system was highly available and scalable to support growth.
- Worked closely with product and operations teams to iterate on features and deliver a production-ready platform.

## Technologies

- Node.js, Express
- PostgreSQL
- Dockerized deployments
- CI/CD pipelines

## Outcome

Delivered a scalable and maintainable product that met the company's performance and reliability goals.

## Problem

Schimerol's legacy system struggled with scale and brittleness: on-boarding new tenants and rolling out features required manual ops, deployments were slow, and performance degraded during peak use.

## Solution

I re-architected the core product with an emphasis on reliability and operability. The new design introduced a clear domain model, resilient APIs, and containerized deployments to allow safe, frequent releases.

## Architecture

```text
Clients (web/mobile) -> API Gateway -> Microservices / Node.js APIs -> Postgres
                                 |                                |
                                 +-> Background workers (queue) -> Metrics & Monitoring
```

### Key features delivered
- Clean RESTful APIs with consistent error handling and pagination
- Schema-driven migrations and a versioned DB strategy
- Containerized services with health checks and automated CI/CD
- Role-based access control and audit logging

## Metrics
- Achieved 99.95% uptime after rollout
- Reduced average response latency by 45% for critical endpoints
- Deployment lead time reduced from days to under 30 minutes

## Lessons learned
- Start with the failure scenarios — designing for common failure modes made the system far more resilient.
- Automating the release pipeline pays off quickly: frequent, small releases lowered risk and increased feedback velocity.

## Next steps
- Add observability dashboards for business KPIs and provision canary deployments for high-risk changes.
