## Overview

Designed and implemented an HR automation solution for Shega Media & Technologies using Microsoft Power Apps to reduce manual data entry and improve consistency.

### What I built

- Automated HR forms and approval flows in Power Apps.
- Integration points to export HR data into internal systems.
- Simple admin interfaces for HR staff to manage workflows.

### Impact

The automation saved roughly 10 hours per week for HR staff and improved data consistency.

## Technologies used

- Microsoft Power Apps
- Integrations with internal APIs

## Outcome

A maintainable HR automation system that reduced manual work and improved operational efficiency.

## Problem

HR processed hiring, leave, and onboarding manually. This caused slow approvals, duplicated entries, and inconsistent employee records.

## Solution

I designed workflows in Power Apps that automated common HR tasks, integrated identity validation and downstream syncs, and provided HR staff with a simple admin console.

## Architecture

```text
Power Apps front-end -> Power Automate flows -> SharePoint Lists
```

### Key components
- Power Apps forms for onboarding, leave requests, and exit procedures
- Power Automate flows for approvals, notifications, and data sync
- Lightweight admin views for HR to audit and correct records

## Features
- One-click onboarding with automated account creation hooks
- Approval workflows with multi-stage sign-off and reminders
- Exportable audit logs and CSV reports

## Metrics
- Saved ~10 hours/week for HR staff
- Reduced data entry errors by an estimated 80%

## Lessons learned
- Low-code platforms can accelerate delivery, but they need strict change-management and documentation.
- Combining low-code UIs with robust API contracts keeps integrations maintainable.

## Next steps
- Add employee self-service portals and integrate SSO for security and ease of use.
