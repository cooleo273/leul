## Overview

Architected and delivered an internal dashboard for Shega Media & Technologies to calculate project viability and financial performance.

### What I built

- Data pipelines to centralize costs and revenue into a single source of truth.
- Visualizations and KPIs for project-level profitability and forecasting.
- Exportable reports for executive review.

### Impact

Centralizing financial data improved C-level forecast accuracy by over 15% and accelerated decision-making.

## Technologies used

- Next.js, React
- PostgreSQL
- Node.js

## Outcome

A production-ready dashboard used by stakeholders to assess project viability and financial performance.

## Problem

Finance and delivery teams lacked a single source to evaluate project profitability. Spreadsheets were out-of-date and inconsistencies in cost allocation led to poor forecasting.

## Solution

I built an internal profitability dashboard that combined automated ingestion of billing and cost data with an intuitive UI for analysts and executives to inspect project-level metrics.

## Architecture

```text
Ingest (ETL) -> Central Postgres (normalized schemas) -> API (Next.js) -> Frontend (Reports & Visualizations)
```

### Key components
- ETL jobs to import billing and time-sheet data
- Normalized data model for costs, revenues, and allocations
- Forecasting module that projects revenue and costs based on historical trends
- Role-based UI with exportable investor-style reports

## Features
- Interactive waterfall charts and unit-economics breakdowns
- Scenario mode for 'what-if' projections
- Scheduled exports and executive summary emails

## Metrics
- Improved forecast accuracy by over 15%
- Reduced manual reconciliation time by ~60%

## Lessons learned
- Establish canonical data boundaries early — it saved time when integrating external billing sources.
- Presenting clear KPIs to stakeholders changed behavior quicker than complex models.

## Next steps
- Add more 'what-if' scenarios and integrate with accounting systems for automated month-end reconciliation.
