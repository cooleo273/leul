## Overview

I architected and built the Nexus backtesting platform from the ground up, owning UI/UX design, frontend implementation, and backend engineering. The platform provides traders with a reliable environment to test strategies against historical market data.

## Key Contributions

- Designed the overall system architecture, including data ingestion, storage, and compute for backtesting large datasets.
- Implemented a performant front-end UI to configure, run, and visualize backtests.
- Built backend services to execute strategies, persist results, and provide analytics.
- Deployed the platform and maintained CI/CD for ongoing releases.

## Technologies

- Next.js, React
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL (or MongoDB depending on dataset needs)
- Containerized deployment (Docker)

## Outcome

Delivered a robust and feature-rich application that enabled traders to iterate quickly on strategies with accurate historical simulations.

## Problem

Traders lacked a reliable environment to validate strategies at scale. Existing tools were either too slow for large datasets or required extensive manual configuration.

## Solution

I designed a system optimized for large-scale backtesting: efficient data ingestion and a compute layer that executed user strategies in isolated, reproducible runs. The UI made it simple to configure experiments and compare results.

## Architecture

```text
Data Ingest -> Partitioned Time-Series Storage -> Compute Cluster (worker pool) -> Results Store -> UI
```

### Key features
- Fast data ingestion and normalization pipelines
- Strategy sandboxing and deterministic execution
- Rich visualizations (equity curves, drawdown, heatmaps)
- Compare multiple runs side-by-side and export results

## Metrics
- Handled backtests over datasets with millions of rows with acceptable latency
- Reduced experiment turnaround time from hours to minutes for many strategy types

## Lessons learned
- Determinism matters: ensuring runs are reproducible simplified debugging and user trust.
- A small compute cluster with good caching provides massive speedups for repeated queries.

## Next steps
- Add distributed backtesting support and cloud-based spot compute for burst workloads.
