## Overview

I architected and built the Nexus backtesting platform from the ground up, owning UI/UX design, frontend implementation, and backend engineering. The platform provides traders with a reliable environment to test strategies against historical market data.

## Key Contributions

- Designed the overall system architecture, including data ingestion, storage, and compute for backtesting large datasets.
- Implemented a performant front-end UI to configure, run, and visualize backtests.
- Built backend services to execute strategies, persist results, and provide analytics.
- Deployed the platform and maintained CI/CD for ongoing releases.

## Technologies

- Next.js, React
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL (or MongoDB depending on dataset needs)
- Containerized deployment (Docker)

## Outcome

Delivered a robust and feature-rich application that enabled traders to iterate quickly on strategies with accurate historical simulations.
