## Overview

At Shega Media & Technologies I led the development of several internal tools to streamline operations and improve decision-making.

### Survey Platform

Built a custom survey collection platform using Next.js and Supabase that replaces a manual process similar to Google Forms. The platform automated data aggregation and reporting, reducing the time to analyze customer feedback by approximately 40%.

### Profitability Dashboard

Architected and delivered an internal dashboard to calculate project viability and financial performance. The dashboard centralized financial data and improved C-level forecast accuracy by over 15%.

### HR Automation (Power Apps)

Designed and implemented an HR automation system using Microsoft Power Apps to reduce manual data entry. The automation saved roughly 10 hours per week for HR staff and improved data consistency.

## Technologies used

- Next.js, React
- Supabase
- PostgreSQL / Supabase database services
- Microsoft Power Apps (for HR automation)
- Node.js

## Outcome

Delivered production-ready internal tools that reduced manual effort, improved reporting accuracy, and supported faster, data-driven decisions.
